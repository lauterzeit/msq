# msq
MSQ-100 Q1 SysEx to Standard MIDI converter

The msq_convert program was written in C++ in 2013, based upon the JUCE v2.0 (https://juce.com/) C++ class library by Raw Material Software. 
They are now up to JUCE v7.0 (Jules' Utility Class Extensions). Bravo Julian Storer!

The code compiled and worked well under JUCE 2.0 - However we make no guarantees it will compile with JUCE v7.0
