# msq
MSQ-100 Q1 SysEx to Standard MIDI converter

msq_convert is a simple command line file translator / converter, allowing you to convert between standard MIDI files and the MSQ-100 'Q1' SysEx format.  
It works in both directions; you can take a Standard MIDI files [exported from Ableton Live clips or other sources] and convert it to the an MSQ SysEx (System Exclusive) file, or the reverse conversion.

The msq_convert program was written in C++ in 2013, based upon the JUCE v2.0 (https://juce.com/) C++ class library by Raw Material Software. 
They are now up to JUCE v7.0 (Jules' Utility Class Extensions). Bravo Julian Storer!

The code compiled and worked well under JUCE 2.0 - However we make no guarantees it will compile with JUCE v7.0
